                    <P><b>DREAM FOR PAKLAND FOR MUSLIMS</b>Iqbal in his famous Allahabad address presented the idea of Pakistan as a separate homeland for the Muslims as a permanent solution to Hindu-Muslim communal tensions. The same idea was later made vibrant in Lahore Resolution in 1940. This demand was given a legal format on the basis of two-nation theory.
